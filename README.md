An atomic css framework good enough for government work.

## What it does
United is an experimental atomic css utility class framework (similar to [Basscss](http://basscss.com/), [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/), or [Solid](http://solid.buzzfeed.com/)) that allows designing for a wide expressive gamut without modifying css. Utility classes are single-use immutable classes that can be chained together to create more sophisticated presentational styles.

## What problem this solves
Among other things, a utility class framework can be helpful to prototype new patterns in a pattern library without modifying production code. It is fast, so a designer or developer could get into design without doing any classing/naming.
